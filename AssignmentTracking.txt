Create an abstract “Device” class with the following: -- Completed, Device folder completed ----
A “Brand” property --Default Public Abstract get/set Completed, ---
A “CPU” property (reference to “CPU” object) -- Completed with public get/set---
A “Memory” property (a list of “Memory” objects) --Completed with public get/set---
A “Connectors” property (a read-only dictionary keyed with values of the Connector enumeration and valued with ints to represent the number of connections available) ---Completed with default public access modifiers-----
A “Peripherals” property (a polymorphic list of Peripheral objects), private -- Completed---

A “ConnectPeripheral()” method that accepts a polymorphic peripheral argument and: --TODO-------!!!!!!!
Throws an exception if there are no available connectors of the connection-type of the peripheral.
Unless the type is “Integrated”.
Otherwise, adds the peripheral to the list.

A “DisconnectPeripheral()” method that accepts a type of peripheral, and will disconnect all connected peripherals of that type.
An abstract “StartUp()” method that will be overridden in each derived class, with some functionality of your choice. Write something to the console, make the computer beep, whatever you’d like.

Create a “CPU” class with the following: --Completed, public class---
A “Brand” property (string).  --Completed, default public get/set prop---
A “Speed” property (double). --Completed, default public get/set prop---

Create a “Memory” class with the following: -- Competed, default public class--
A “Brand” property (string). --Completed, default public string get/set---
A “Size” property (int). --Completed, default public int get/set---


---------------------EVERYTHING HERE IS WITHIN "DEVICE" NAMEPSACE-------------------------------------------------

Create a “Laptop” class derived from “Device” with the following: --Completed with default public class--
A “Screen” property that must have a “Screen” object with the “Integrated” connector type assigned. --Completed with default public get/set------
A “Keyboard” property that must have a “Keyboard” object with the “Integrated” connector type assigned. ---Completed with default public get/set------
A default and greedy constructor.----Completed with default creedy constructor------
